I work almost exclusively from my home office and I like to use good quality products that make my working life more comfortable.

‚ÑπÔ∏è I change aspects of my setup fairly often so this page will serve as a living document and a place to point curious developers to when I get asked.

## Hardware

### Computer

14" Apple M1 MacBook Pro üíª. I love this little thing. It should last a while.

### Monitor

[MSI Prestige PS341WU Creator Monitor 34"](https://www.msi.com/Content-Creation-Monitor/Prestige-PS341WU). Great wide-screen monitor without being too pricey.

### Keyboard

[Keychron Q1 version 2](https://keychron.in/product/keychron-q1-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard/) Keyboard. I bought the barebones ISO version, Gateron Oil King switches and PBTFans Resonance keycaps from [Mech Mods](https://www.mechmods.co.uk/). What's not to love?

### Mouse

I alternate between the [Logitech MX Master 3](http://amzn.eu/iGzdIg0) and the [Logitech Vertical mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse).

### Desk and chair

[Autonomous Smart Desk 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-home). An amazing and affordable standing desk and the [Herman Miller Aeron](https://www.hermanmiller.com/en_gb/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/). You need to invest in a good chair if you're going to be sitting in it for hours on end.

## Software

### IDE

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has now been replaced by [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) now, although Cursor becomes quite laggy from time to time so I use [Zed](https://zed.dev/) as a backup.

I tend to switch my colour themes fairly often, but these are the most used:

- [Ros√© Pine Moon](https://github.com/rose-pine/vscode#readme)
- [Catppuccin Mocha](https://github.com/catppuccin/vscode)
- [Rigel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mrmartineau.rigel-vscode) which I made actually

I also switch the fonts I use too:

- [Comic Code](https://tosche.net/fonts/comic-code) font (as much as I hate Comic Sans, I happen to LOVE Comic Code for coding.. who knew!)
- [Recursive Mono](https://www.recursive.design/)
- [Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/).

A copy of my `settings.json` can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/mrmartineau/ea3b428124bc1e31cd46dfa55469d781) and a full list of my installed extensions can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/mrmartineau/28ef03c53275ea468e470532d6d20449).

#### Extensions

- [Surround](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yatki.vscode-surround) a simple yet powerful extension to add wrapper templates around your code blocks. It has many built-in templates and you can add your own. I've added a few of my own templates to the settings below.
- [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens)
- [Multiple cursor case preserve](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Cardinal90.multi-cursor-case-preserve)
- [Project Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.project-manager)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Rewrap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stkb.rewrap)
- [Toggle Quotes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BriteSnow.vscode-toggle-quotes)
- [Turbo Console Log](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChakrounAnas.turbo-console-log)
- [Sublime Commands](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zarel.sublime-commands)
- [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)

### Browser

[Arc](https://arc.net/) by The Browser Company. Arc has been my main browser for a while now. It is a fantastic Chromium-based browser so all my favourite Chrome extensions still work.

### Other apps

#### [Raycast](https://raycast.com/)

I use it in nearly every aspect of my work. I use it for searching the web with its custom web searches (e.g. npm, JIRA, bundlephobia, MDN and many more); searching npm with the [npm extension](https://www.raycast.com/mrmartineau/search-npm) (that I created) workflow and loads more. It truly is a massive productivity booster.

FYI I also created the [GitHub Stars extension](https://www.raycast.com/mrmartineau/search-github-stars).

- [Toothpick](https://www.raycast.com/VladCuciureanu/toothpick) - Manage Bluetooth connections
- [JIRA](https://www.raycast.com/raycast/jira) - Interact with JIRA
- [Set Audio Device](https://www.raycast.com/benvp/audio-device) - Set the input/output audio device

#### [1Password](https://1password.com/)

I never need to worry about passwords anymore. It integrates with my browser (via their extension) and it copies one-time passwords to the clipboard automatically. It's also great on the iPhone; since iOS 12 was released, the integration with the OS is massively improved.

#### [DevUtils](https://devutils.app/?ref=zander)

This app is a recent addition and is an indispensible tool for my workflow.

#### [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

I moved to Obsidian a while back and haven't looked back.

#### [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) with [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/)

To improve my shell, I use the excellent [TIDE](https://github.com/IlanCosman/tide) prompt and [Fig](https://fig.io) which adds IDE-style autocomplete to my terminal.

I also use a few other CLI apps to make the experience better, in particular, [ni](https://github.com/antfu/ni) by [Anthony Fu](https://antfu.me). It is great for installing npm packages and running npm scripts. I bounce from project to project a lot and they often use different package managers. This tool makes it easy to install packages and run scripts without having to remember which package manager to use.

#### [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac)

An excellent git client for Mac.

#### [NextDNS](https://www.nextdns.io/)

A cloud-based private DNS service that gives you full control over what is allowed and what is blocked on the Internet. There are Mac and iPhone apps that essentially block ads, malicious code and more.

### And the rest:

- [Superkey](https://superkey.app/): "Keyboard superpower on macOS". I use this mainly for its "hyperkey" functionality (where caps lock is converted to a "hyper key", with all these four modifiers combined: `‚åÉ‚å•‚åò‚áß`). FYI Raycast now has hyperkey functionality built-in, but I found it buggy so I still use this.
- [Rectangle Pro](https://rectangleapp.com/): Window snapping and positioning
- [Vivid](https://www.getvivid.app/) - Double brightness system-wide
- [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash): Dash is an API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager. Devdocs.io or the [Devdocs app](https://devdocs.egoist.rocks/) are free alternatives.
- [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/): The best personal VPN service in my opinion. Great apps for Mac and iPhone.
- [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/): Hide some of those pesky menubar items.
- [Shottr](https://shottr.cc) - Shottr is a small, fast, human-sized screenshot app built for those who care about pixels. It was crafted with Swift, optimized for M1, and is completely free at the moment.
- [AudioSwitcher](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/audioswitcher/id561712678) - AudioSwitcher is a menu bar that allows you to switch quickly between all available input and output devices.

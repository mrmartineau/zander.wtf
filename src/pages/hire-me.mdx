## About me

I am a front-end specialist (but am comfortable across the entire stack) with over 15 years of experience across a range of business sectors; recently I have worked in the financial, music and health sectors.

I am passionate about user interface design, user experience and development, and I enjoy both the minutiae of UI design in Sketch, Figma etc and deploying designs at scale using design systems and component libraries.

I believe technology is only a tool, and building great products requires a broad application of technologies that no one developer can master. That said, my core expertise is in the broader JavaScript ecosystem.

I am proficient in web application design and engineering using **React**, Next.js, GraphQL, **TypeScript**, web standards and various other frameworks, libraries and tools (see more in the Highlights section below).

I care about the impact I can have in your company, and the positive impact we’ll have together for the benefit of our users. **Accessibility**, **inclusivity** and **performance** are at the heart of what I do; what we create has to work for the greatest number of users.

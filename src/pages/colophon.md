This, the **2023** version of my site was originally built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) (here's the [repo](https://github.com/mrmartineau/zander.wtf-2023)). I had used it successfully for my [Code Notes](https://notes.zander.wtf) loved the simplicity and the fact that it was just a static site generator. I also wanted to move away from Gatsby which my previous site was built with. Using React for a personal site felt like overkill and I wanted to try something new.

Whilst building the Eleventy site I became more and more interested in [Astro](https://astro.build), and after trying out its example project I decided to rebuild the site with it - even though I hadn't released the 11ty version. Astro is great because it is a static site generator but `.astro` components use JSX syntax, which I'm very familiar with. It also has a great dev experience and is very fast.

[Astro](https://astro.build/), but I decided to go with Astro for the final version. I'm using [Astro](https://astro.build/) for the following reasons:

## Fonts

Headings are set in **Mona Sans** and body copy is set in **Hubot Sans** from [GitHub](https://github.com/mona-sans).

This, the **2023** version of my site was originally built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) (11ty). I had used it successfully for version 2 of my [Code Notes](https://notes.zander.wtf) project and loved its simplicity but I also wanted to move away from Gatsby which my previous site was built with (the 2020 version). Using React for a personal site felt like overkill and I wanted to try something new.

Whilst building the 11ty site I became more and more interested in [Astro](https://astro.build), and after trying out its example project I decided to rebuild the site with it - even though I still hadn't released the 11ty version. Astro is great because, like 11ty, it's a static site generator but `.astro` components use JSX syntax, which I'm very familiar with â€“ I write React apps for a living and I love the simplicity of JSX so Astro was a natural fit. The component and data fetching model was extremely easy to pick up and I was able to rebuild the site in a few days.

The type is set in **Mona Sans** and **Hubot Sans** from [GitHub](https://github.com/mona-sans).

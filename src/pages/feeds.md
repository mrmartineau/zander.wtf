You can use a feed reader (also known as an RSS reader) to stay up to date with my site and my other activities on the web. Iâ€™ve got a few different feeds you can subscribe to:

- [Blog](/blog.rss.xml)
- [Links](/links.rss.xml)
- [Code Notes](https://notes.zander.wtf/feed.xml)
- [Letterboxd Movie Diary](https://letterboxd.com/mrmartineau/rss/)

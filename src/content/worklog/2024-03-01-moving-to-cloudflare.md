After the [craziness where a Netlify customer was charged $104K](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1b14bty/netlify_just_sent_me_a_104k_bill_for_a_simple/) because of a DDoS attack, I decided to move my personal site and as many web things to Cloudflare. Most of my sites are on Vercel and I have a few on Netlify and while I love their services, I don't want to take any chances.

I finished creating the page metadata scraper that's built with Cloudflare Workers. It uses `HTMLRewriter` to parse the page and extract content. It will be integrated into Otter soon.

The repo for it is here: [github.com/mrmartineau/cloudflare-worker-scraper](https://github.com/mrmartineau/cloudflare-worker-scraper)

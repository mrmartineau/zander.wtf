title: Otter Collections

Added collections to Otter. Collections are not another entity like tags, but are created implicitly when you use a tag with a colon in, for example with the `ai:openai` or `ai:anthropic` tags the collection would be `ai` for both items. I use this form or grouping throughout Otter and I always wanted a simple way for collections to be displayed in the app, and now that they're here, I can't believe I didn't do it sooner!

I also added a tag management page so users can rename tags. It has helped me group more tags together into collections, and I'm sure it will help others too.

This work contributed to the [v2.4.1 release](https://github.com/mrmartineau/Otter/releases/tag/v2.4.1).

One of the AI features the Arc browser recently introduced renames tabs and downloaded files. It is a really small and simple thing but it made me think that Otter could use something similar. When adding new bookmarks, the titles often use very different formatting from one site to the next. This makes it hard to scan the list of bookmarks and find the one you are looking for. It would be nice if Otter could automatically rename the bookmarks to something more consistent.

I also improved the Toast component. I opted to replace the existing Toast component with a new one that is more easy to use called [Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/).

This work contributed to the [v2.3.1 Otter release](https://github.com/mrmartineau/Otter/releases/tag/v2.3.1)

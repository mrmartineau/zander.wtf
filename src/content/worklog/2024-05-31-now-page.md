title: Add Now page

I finally added a `/now` page to this site. It is pretty basic right now but I hope to add more content to it soon.

Currently it contains my recent watching and listening info. The movies use my Letterboxd watch diary; the TV shows come from a Notion page; and the music comes from the Last.fm API.

The last.fm API is quite annoying because it doesn't return artist images, so I had to use the Spotify API for those instead.

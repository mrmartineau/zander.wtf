I finished the Mastodon to Supabase Cloudflare worker. This is used to saved my toots and faved toots to [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrmartineau/Otter/main/public/otter-logo.svg" width="30" height="30" class="mx-2 inline border-none" /> Otter's](https://github.com/mrmartineau/Otter) database.

The repo for it is here: [github.com/mrmartineau/mastodon-to-supabase](https://github.com/mrmartineau/mastodon-to-supabase)

subtitle: The journey to give my son access to music he loves in a ‚Äúslow‚Äù, non-screen way

My son recently turned 6, and like most kids, he loves music, TV, movies, toys and is interested in photography in as much that he likes the pictures that shuffle past on our digital photo frame in our kitchen.

Since he was born, we've maintained a Spotify playlist of his favourite tracks, most of which come from movie soundtracks. He has an amazing capacity to listen to some tracks on repeat for hours, often to the annoyance of my wife and me. There's only so much repetition we can take of "Sunflower" by Post Malone from the Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse soundtrack - a movie he adores.

I wanted him to have some independence with his listening habits, so he didn‚Äôt have to rely on us all the time - and to not totally ruin my Spotify listening habits and recommendations üòÑ. What better way to do that than to give him what I had as a kid: a walkman. It just so happens that we have a pretty good working Sony Walkman that I gave to my wife a few years back. I set about recording his playlist onto an audio cassette; here begins my foray into

After a lot of research, I finally bought the **Bush Cassette Player and Recorder**, some audio cassettes and a 3.5mm audio cable. It is not a good device but did what I wanted for a fairly inexpensive price. I hooked it up to my laptop, hit record on the recorder and hit play on Spotify. After about 30 seconds, I stopped everything so I could check the audio quality. It was awful. There was loads of background noise and the music could hardly be made out.

A little searching around later revealed that devices like this often produce noise when plugged in to mains, so I tried using battery power instead. It took 4 of those massive ‚ÄúC‚Äù batteries which I haven‚Äôt used in probably 20 years.

With the batteries in, I tested the recording for the 2nd time. There was still noise but nowhere near as much as before - it would have to do. About an hour later I had produced my son‚Äôs 1st mixtape and the 1st mixtape I had made in over 25 years. I wrote the tracks on the card and gave it to him after he came back from school.

His Bluetooth Belkin headphones can also take a 3.5mm audio cable, so they were perfect to connect to the Walkman. It took him a little getting used to, but after a while he could be seen wandering around listening to his mixtape all the time. It was a wonderful thing to see.

After the mixtape had been in use for a while, I remembered I had an old iPod shuffle lying around. Remember the tiny ones that clip to your clothes? The smaller form-factor and more modern tech meant that I could keep the quality high and he could still have the tracks that he loves with him at all times. The one snag with this was that I now only use Spotify and have very little music (mp3s etc) on my computer. So how do I get mp3s of all the songs? I turned to [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to convert YouTube music videos to mp3s.

Installing `yt-dlp` isn‚Äôt hard on a Mac if you have Homebrew (`brew install yt-dlp`) but there are many other installation instructions on its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

Now all I had to do was to find the right YouTube video, copy its ID from the url and run the below script:

```bash
# yt-dlp {youtube id} -x --audio-format=mp3
yt-dlp oCcks-fwq2c -x --audio-format=mp3
```

Once all the tracks were saved, I uploaded them onto the shuffle.

The iPod shuffle was a massive success! It was much easier than the Walkman for him to learn and use, plus the quality was so much better. We took it with us on holiday to Spain recently and the kids from the other family also loved it so much that they fought over it a few times.. and ‚ÄúSunflower‚Äù was on hard rotation there as well!!

So it seems that is the end of the journey... not quite. Downloading tracks from YouTube isn‚Äôt legal so I needed an alternative, and quick! As luck would have it I stumbled on a fairly new device called the [Mighty Vibe](https://www.mightyaudio.co.uk/products/mighty-vibe). It is very similar to the old iPod shuffle but plays Spotify or Amazon Music tracks instead. Using the smartphone app I can manage what is saved to the device. It has Bluetooth and can connect to a 3.5mm cable so it is perfect for our needs. It is the best of both worlds: a device without a screen that my son can use without fear of breaking. He can keep it for himself and do what he wants with it.

Along the same lines as this, I have been resurrecting other ‚Äúretro‚Äù things for my son to use like cameras, Game Boys and toys. If I get time, I‚Äôll write about them too.
